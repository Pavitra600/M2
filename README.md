# EX-06 - Looping
## AIM:
Write a C program to print even numbers ranging from M to N (including M and N values).

## ALGORITHM:
1.	Declare two integer variables to store the values of M and N.
2.	Use the printf function to prompt the user to enter the values of M and N.
3.	Use the scanf function to read the values of M and N from the user.
4.	Use a loop (for or while) to iterate from M to N.
5.	Inside the loop, check if the current number is even.
6.	If the current number is even, print it.
7.	Continue the loop until you have iterated through all numbers from M to N.

## PROGRAM:
```
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int m,n;
    scanf("%d%d",&m,&n);
    
    for(int i=m;i<=n;i++)
    {
        if(i%2 ==0){
            printf("%d ",i);
        }
        
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## RESULT:

# EX-07-Nested-loop

## AIM:

Write a C program to print the given triangular pattern using loop.

## ALGORITHM:

1.	Declare a variable to store the number of rows in the triangle.
2.	Use the printf function to prompt the user to enter the number of rows.
3.	Use a loop (for or while) to iterate through each row.
4.	Inside the loop, use another loop to print the desired number of asterisks for each row.
5.	Continue the loop until you have printed the entire triangular pattern.

## PROGRAM:
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = n; i >= 1; i--) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
            printf("a");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```
## OUTPUT:

# EX-08-Functions

## AIM:

Write a C program to perform multiplication and division of two numbers using functions (With argument and without return type).

## ALGORITHM:

1.	Declare two functions: one for multiplication and one for division, both taking two integer arguments.

2. In the multiplication function, multiply the two integers and print the result.

3. In the division function, divide the first integer by the second and print the result.

4. In the main function, declare two integer variables and read their values from the user.

5. Call the multiplication and division functions, passing the two numbers as arguments.
   
## PROGRAM:
```
#include <stdio.h>
void multiply(int a, int b) {
    printf("Multiplication: %d\n", a * b);
}

void divide(int a, int b) {
    if (b != 0) {
        printf("Division: %.2f\n", (float)a / b);
    } else {
        printf("Error: Division by zero\n");
    }
}

int main() {
    int num1, num2;
    scanf("%d %d", &num1, &num2);
    multiply(num1, num2);
    divide(num1, num2);
    return 0;
}

```

## RESULT:

Thus the program to perform multiplication and division of two numbers using functions has been executed successfully
 
 

# EX-09-Use Do While Loop

## AIM:

Write a c program to find the sum of Odd digits using do while loop in a Given range

## ALGORITHM:

1. Declare variables to store the input number and the sum of odd digits.

2. Initialize the sum of odd digits to 0.

3. Use a for loop to iterate through each digit of the input number.

4. Inside the loop, extract the rightmost digit using digit = number % 10 and reduce the number using number = number / 10.

5. If the digit is odd, add it to the sum of odd digits.

6. Print the sum of odd digits.

## PROGRAM:
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int start, end, sum = 0, i;
    scanf("%d %d", &start, &end);
    
    i = start;
    do {
        if (i % 2 != 0) sum += i;
        i++;
    } while (i <= end);
    
    printf("%d\n", sum);
    return 0;
}
```

# EX â€“ 10 - Odd Number
## AIM:
Write a C program to check whether the given number is  odd number and it is greater than 25 or not using nested if.
## ALGORITHM:

1. Start.

2. Declare the function fact().

3. In the main() function, call the fact() function.

4. Inside the fact() function: a. Declare variables i, N, and fact (initialized to 1). b. Read an integer N from the user. c. Use a for loop to multiply fact by i from 1 to N. d. After the loop, print the factorial value.

5. End.

## PROGRAM:
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    int a;
    scanf("%d",&a);
    
    if(a%2 != 0){
        if(a >= 25){
            printf("The number is odd\n");
            printf("The number is greater than or equal to 25\n");
        }
        else{
            printf("the number is not equal to 25\n");
        }
    }
    else{
        printf("The number is NOT an odd number\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
